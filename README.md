# Ollama-J.A.R.V.I.S-windows-
This is code that allows you to run an ollama model (specifically llama3 . 2 however modifying the script can change the model) with a GUI that is named JARVIS and runs locally install.
(NOTE: This is a test version so I am not responsible for any problems or broken packages)
